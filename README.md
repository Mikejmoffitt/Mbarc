Moffitt's Bogus Architecture! 

This is my attempt at making an extremely tiny architecture and emulator (or really more of a virtual machine). I've never looked into making an emulator nor had any formal training, so this is just seeing what I can come up with...

The CPU is 16-bit, instructions, operations, and all. 

All operations are done on a memory bank, and other than a few flags and such there are no general purpose CPU registers. The instruction set was initially similar to the MOS 6502, but more recently it has begun to resemble the Motorola 68000. 

We'll see when this thing is further working how useful it can be. It's just a little experiment based on how my mind imagines an emulator might work.
