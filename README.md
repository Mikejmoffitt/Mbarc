Moffitt's Bogus Architecture! 

This is my attempt at making an extremely tiny architecture and emulator. I've never looked into making an emulator nor had any formal training, so this is just seeing what I can come up with...

The CPU is 8-bit with an 8-bit address size so it's not particularly useful, but it could be used as a tool to help people learn the idea of logic flow in assembly who are completely unfamiliar. 

All operations are done on a memory bank, and other than a few flags there are no CPU registers. The instruction set is modeled a little after the MOS 6502 as it is the CPU I am most familiar with (which does not mean much). This may make it extremely approachable to someone who has never touched assembly and needs to wrap one's head around the very basics. 

I don't know. We'll see when this thing is working how useful it can be. It's just a little experiment based on how my mind imagines an emulator might work.
